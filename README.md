# go-collections
This repo is meant to be used as a learning tool for golang implmentations of different data structures and algorithms.
None of these resources should be used in production as they will not be implemented with the intent of thread safety, nor extensive testing. Please checkout [golang-collections](https://godoc.org/github.com/golang-collections/collections) as this repo is based on the tools shown there.
